They had an existing door configurator that dynamically rendered 2D door designs using images and svgs. It was functionally OK, and quite clever behind the scenes but visually it was looking tired and was not user friendly.<\/p>\n<p>Smart have a range of 50+ doors that are highly customisable and they were looking for a &#8216;best in class&#8217; way of showing them off and demonstrating how bespoke they are.<\/p>\n<p>We experimented with a few ideas making some scrappy prototypes and eventually settled on using 3D. The existing print material user realistic 3D renders so we already had a decent amount of 3D assets to work with and it showcased the door in the best light.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n \n<section class=\"toh-block toh-block--video\">\n<div class=\"textured-bg\"><\/div>\n    <div class=\"wrapper\">\n    <div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n        <iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/1060048947?h=8ca1d07ff9&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&#038;background=1&#038;loop=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"rating-emotions\">\n\n        <\/iframe>\n    <\/div>\n    <script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n           \n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"tombo-block tombo-text-block\">\n\t<div class=\"wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Using <a href=\"https:\/\/threejs.org\/\">Three.js<\/a> I built the configurator with the ability to change colours, hardware and glazing options. This all tied into an API that sent the door designs off to installers in the local area. The site is full responsive and performant on mobile as well as desktop. We used draco compression on the 3D models to keep the filesize nice and small.<\/p>\n<p>We tied it all together with a WordPress site showing off all the doors features and connected the two with favouring colours and styles within the website. This became short cuts that you could use a starting off point to jump into the configurator.<\/p>\n<p>It was a really fun project to be involved in, and I enjoyed being part of the creative process and helping to shape the ideas.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"toh-block toh-block--three-images\">\n        <div class=\"three-images\">\n            <div class=\"textured-bg\"><\/div>\n                                            <figure class=\"\">\n                                            <div style=\"padding:216.22% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n                            <iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/1060082461?h=8ca1d07ff9&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&#038;background=1&#038;loop=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;
