Walmart had lots of map based data broken down by states and <a href=\"https:\/\/d3js.org\/\">D3.js<\/a> was used to display this. The data itself was entered into a WordPress backend and served up as json for the D3 library.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n \n<section class=\"toh-block toh-block--video\">\n<div class=\"textured-bg\"><\/div>\n    <div class=\"wrapper\">\n    <div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n        <iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/1060255926?h=8ca1d07ff9&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&#038;background=1&#038;loop=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"rating-emotions\">\n\n        <\/iframe>\n    <\/div>\n    <script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n           \n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"tombo-block tombo-text-block\">\n\t<div class=\"wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>GSAP scroll trigger is used to control animation and is combined with <a href=\"https:\/\/alvarotrigo.com\/fullPage\/\">Fullpage.js<\/a> to keep it slide by slide and full screen. There are also some custom hand coded animations for charts.<\/p>\n<p>The tricky part of this build was making everything fit within one screen at the majority of viewports. This involved a heavy dose of programtism and locking the max sizes at certain viewports and absolutely positioning elements. This is not recommended for dynamic copy obviously, but as this is more of a infographic there was some solid ground to work from for content length. For mobile fitting all the content on one screen at a time was impossible, so the full page was only turned on for viewports above a certain size. <\/p>\n<p>The chapter navigation on the side required some wrangling of GSAP scroll trigger so I could trigger the right chapter and reset animations after each slide. The GSAP library has come along way in the short time since this was built and now has a lot of the functionality I had to patch together out of the box. Fullpage js has some nice hooks that can be called before and after slides which made making the chapter \/ navigation respond nice and easy.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"toh-block toh-block--three-images\">\n        <div class=\"three-images\">\n            <div class=\"textured-bg\"><\/div>\n                                            <figure class=\"\">\n                                            <div style=\"padding:216.22% 0 0 0;position:relative;\">\n                            <iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/1060257240?h=8ca1d07ff9&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&#038;background=1&#038;loop=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;
