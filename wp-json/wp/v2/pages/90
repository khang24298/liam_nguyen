In English, that means the sites I build are fast, and well-structured which means google likes them. Being accessible means that everyone can use them. The structure of the site, and how easy it is to use and edit is often a part of design that people overlook. I love building sites in a modular way (often with WordPress) and seeing a clients reaction when they see how easy it is to add to their site.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"tombo-block tombo-text-block\">\n\t<div class=\"wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Functional Design<\/h2>\n<p>I am good at functional design and working out simple ways to get things to work. I&#8217;m a massive fan of rapid prototyping and it is often a vital part of the design process. Functional design is more concerned with how things work, then how they look and bleeds into UX (user experience) design.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"tombo-block tombo-text-block\">\n\t<div class=\"wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">UX Design<\/h2>\n<p>User experience design (often shortened to UX) has a lot of depth to it and is a discipline in it&#8217;s own right. My breadth of web related skills, and 15 years in the game means I know the core principles of UX and am more than capable of organising content and wireframing. That being said, it depends on the scope and size of the project.<\/p>\n<p>Shopping sites and eCommerce with high footfall are examples where an expert UX designer could make huge differences to revenue. If the scope is too big for me I know several talented freelance UX designers that I can call upon.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"tombo-block tombo-text-block\">\n\t<div class=\"wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">UI Design<\/h2>\n<p>User Interface design is essentially &#8216;how it looks and feels&#8217;. It&#8217;s more than this though, and there are many sides to it. For instance people like me who code on the front-end (i.e. the bit you see) of a website are often referred to as &#8216;interface engineers&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>I have done UI design for charities and local businesses that already have an established brand. With brand guidelines you can go a long way to creating a fantastic looking website as the rules \/ tropes of websites are so standard.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n<section class=\"tombo-block tombo-text-block\">\n\t<div class=\"wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Branding<\/h2>\n<p>This is the bit I don&#8217;t do. Logo design and establishing a brand from scratch. I am well connected to some fanastic designers and agencies in the Bristol area and beyond though and often call on their services if and when this required.<\/p>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n<\/section>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":450,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-90","page","type-page","status-publish","hentry"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Web Design in Bristol - liamnguyen.dev<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web design in Bristol by freelance web developer Tom Harrison.
