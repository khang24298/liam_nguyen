					<h1>Matter iOS App</h1>
<h3>Client: <a href="https://matter.xyz">Matter</a></h3>
<p>From 2022 to the end of 2024 I worked for an American start-up on a <a href="https://matter.xyz">neuroscience iOS app</a>. It is currently rated 5 stars and was awarded Apple&#8217;s Featured App of the Day.</p>
<p>I was initially hired for rapid prototyping and for helping with user interface ideas and was the first developer other than the team lead to join the team. It was assumed that we would work in any language and medium (most probably web-related) to hash out user interface ideas. Still, I quickly became a solid member of our expanded dev team of five working in Swift and SwiftUI. As well as just regular dev work I become the bridge between development and design and headed up quality control to make sure our dev work was matching the designs perfectly.</p>
<p>As a solo freelancer for over a decade, it was a great experience to work in a full-on software development team using proper processes like regular stand-ups and sprints. I was working alongside iOS developers with much more experience than me, and it was a great learning experience being a junior again.</p>

					<p>As the bridge between development and design I had one foot in each camp. I helped with ideation and working out what was possible and what was on the <em>edge</em> of possible. SwiftUI is really great and doing simple things fast, but there comes a point where you have to hit it with a hammer if you want anything other than stock. Part of my job was wielding this hammer and knowing when to stop and when it hit it more.</p>
<p>I enjoyed flexing some creative front-end muscles and working closely with designers. Many of the ideas that made it to the final app started as kernels between myself and design. I&#8217;d hash out a some prototypes, design would take these functional ideas and make them look great and we&#8217;d iterate over and over again until it was shiny.</p>
<p>It was a team effort with a real mixture of skills that made it possible, but I&#8217;m proud to see at least some of my grubby fingerprints on the app. The memory card and emotion ratings were two of the projects where I was the project lead. The macro / micro universe inside your head theme was also something I helped shape (in case it wasn&#8217;t obvious, I like sci-fi and space).</p>
<p>It was humbling to work with people who were much better than me in their field with some serious technical chops in both design and coding.</p>
<p>It also helped bring my strengths into focus. I now know for sure, that I am happiest in that space between dev and design. That shared language between these two disciplines is so often lacking and I love doing justice to the design and giving it the care and attention that it deserves.</p>

					<p>On a personal level it was a real experience being involved in large group discussions and contributing creative ideas in a live and ever changing environment. My skills as a freelancer with project management, time keeping, scoping and knowing how to hit deadlines helped to adapt to the hectic nature of a start up.</p>
<p>It was a fully remote position, so I&#8217;ve really learnt how to remote work and upped my timezone maths game.</p>
<p>We had regular in real life meet-ups so I was lucky enough to visit America several times. I met some great people and discovered that I can pick up new programming languages like Swift. Thanks to a work colleague who <em>really</em> likes Taylor Swift I also discovered, that I too, really like Taylor Swift.</p>

					<h1>Smart 3D Door Builder</h1>
<h3>Client: <a href="https://sosdesign.co.uk">SOS Design</a></h3>
<p>Working with <a href="http://sosdesign.co.u">SOS Design</a> we were asked to pitch to create a new website and door configurator Smart&#8217;s designer door range. They had an existing door configurator that dynamically rendered 2D door designs using images and svgs. It was functionally OK, and quite clever behind the scenes but visually it was looking tired and was not user friendly.</p>
<p>Smart have a range of 50+ doors that are highly customisable and they were looking for a &#8216;best in class&#8217; way of showing them off and demonstrating how bespoke they are.</p>
<p>We experimented with a few ideas making some scrappy prototypes and eventually settled on using 3D. The existing print material user realistic 3D renders so we already had a decent amount of 3D assets to work with and it showcased the door in the best light.</p>

					<p>Using <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> I built the configurator with the ability to change colours, hardware and glazing options. This all tied into an API that sent the door designs off to installers in the local area. The site is full responsive and performant on mobile as well as desktop. We used draco compression on the 3D models to keep the filesize nice and small.</p>
<p>We tied it all together with a WordPress site showing off all the doors features and connected the two with favouring colours and styles within the website. This became short cuts that you could use a starting off point to jump into the configurator.</p>
<p>It was a really fun project to be involved in, and I enjoyed being part of the creative process and helping to shape the ideas.</p>

					<p>GSAP scroll trigger is used to control animation and is combined with <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/">Fullpage.js</a> to keep it slide by slide and full screen. There are also some custom hand coded animations for charts.</p>
<p>The tricky part of this build was making everything fit within one screen at the majority of viewports. This involved a heavy dose of programtism and locking the max sizes at certain viewports and absolutely positioning elements. This is not recommended for dynamic copy obviously, but as this is more of a infographic there was some solid ground to work from for content length. For mobile fitting all the content on one screen at a time was impossible, so the full page was only turned on for viewports above a certain size. </p>
<p>The chapter navigation on the side required some wrangling of GSAP scroll trigger so I could trigger the right chapter and reset animations after each slide. The GSAP library has come along way in the short time since this was built and now has a lot of the functionality I had to patch together out of the box. Fullpage js has some nice hooks that can be called before and after slides which made making the chapter / navigation respond nice and easy.</p>

					<h1>Youdoo Pledge Site</h1>
<h3>Client: <a href="https://weareoku.design/">Oku</a></h3>
<p>Working with Bristol design studio <a href="https://weareoku.design/">Oku</a> I built a community platform site designed to empower Bristolians to take action towards Bristol’s goal of reaching net-zero by 2030. The site has suggestions for small changes we can make now to help the environment.</p>

					<p>It makes heavy use of Oku&#8217;s excellent animation skills in After Effects using Lottie to deliver them in a nice efficient web format, including an intro to the whole site.</p>
<p>The site has some nice CSS touches like the off canvas menu, old school news ticker and some funky CSS grid-based layouts. The actions grids needed the information to load neatly under each row of 3, but this content was fully dynamic. Javascript was used to insert this data in the right place. With JS turned off the actions just worked as links to the indivual action so the site still functions well &#8211; a nice progressive enhancement.</p>
<p>The home page use Fullpage.js for nice slide by slide full screen presentation with each Lottie animation triggered on slide change. </p>
<p>The pledge system used cookies to remember the uses choice and then some custom WordPress code to insert entries into the pledge table for use with the ticker.</p>

					<h1>BBC Body Scrubs</h1>
<h3>Client: <a href="https://bbc.co.uk">BBC</a></h3>
<p><strong>Trigger warning:</strong> Some of the videos are a little gory, so not for everyone.</p>
<p>Working with (at the time) freelance designer Chris Chapman we created a site to showcase some gross-out body shock videos the BBC had. They were experimenting with a draggable interface for video.</p>

					<p>The site uses CRT monitor effect and some subtle animation. We kept the site super minimal to be inkeeping with the iplayer style aesthetic but with a little more edginess to match the content.</p>

					<h1>Rabble Film Production Microsite</h1>
<h3>Client: <a href="https://rabblefilm.co.uk">Rabble</a></h3>
<p>Rabble wanted to showcase their video production skills by putting their work front and centre.</p>
<p>The site is super minimal letting the videos do all the heavy lifting. We used vimeo for hosting for smooth load times, but then used built in html5 video players to allow us to use the CSS property object-fit on videos. This allowed background fullscreen videos that cropped nicely from the centre.</p>
