					<h1>The Maintenance burden of WordPress</h1>
<p>One of the main criticisms for WordPress is the maintenance burden. WordPress plugins, themes and WordPress itself have frequent updates. Fail to update these regularly and your site is less secure and more vulnerable to hacking. Whats the best way of dealing with this? Some critics would say don’t use WordPress at all and just use something else (Craft says this a lot!)</p>
<h2 class="p1">WordPress is Ubiquitous so it’s a target</h2>
<p>WordPress powers about a 40% of websites on the internet. This ubiquity draws attention and is largely the reason why it’s targeted more than some other CMSs. It’s not that it’s inherently less secure it’s just more well known and more targeted.</p>
<p>The plugins are also widely varying in quality and security levels.</p>
<p>Still, even if it’s not just a WordPress issue, we still have the maintenance burden to contend with.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Update Regularly</h2>
<p>So how to deal with this? One option is just treat it like a chore and stay on top of it. Login at least once a month and hit that update all button.</p>
<p>The key to this, is having backups. Most hosting services offer daily backups as standard and it’s usually something like 30 days of backups.</p>
<p>With backups in place, you can hit update and not have to worry about that very rare edge case where it breaks your site. If it does, just reinstate the backup and then your site is back up and running and someone can investigate the reason why a plugin causes problems in a calm and measured way.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Auto updates</h2>
<p>These days I take it a step further than this. I just set everything to auto update. Plugins, the WordPress core &#8211; anything that will let me.</p>
<p>Again, backups do a lot of the heavy lifting here should anything go wrong. More than this though, by updating frequently and automatically it’s much easier to pinpoint why and why things go wrong.</p>
<p>If you update plugins manually and forget to do it for 6 months, and then run a load of updates and it falls over, what caused it? A plugin might have had 4 updates since then. Was it the first update that broke your site? The third one?</p>
<p>By keeping in top of it constantly you always know it was the very latest changes that caused problems and this helps immensely in fixing it.</p>
<p>So whether you do it manually or automatically, the trick is to do it regularly. If you are frequently updating your site then maybe doing it manually is right for you. If you see these little red update icons just go for it every time.</p>
<p>If you leave your site for long periods without logging in then auto updates may serve you well.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Maintenance Contracts</h2>
<p>The third option is to pay someone (like me!) to do the updates for you. If your site is really small then this is highly likely a waste of money.</p>
<p>I only tend to do maintenance contracts if there are other updates to the site other than literally just clicking an update button. People are paying me to write new code or new features or tweaking page layouts which makes a lot more sense.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>As few plugins as possible</h2>
<p>The final thing to do say, is that you should have as few plugins installed as possible. The reason I can leave my sites on auto update and they keep on ticking over is because I only use a handful of heavily road tested plugins.</p>
<p>If you start installing plugins to add functionality to your site, then know there is a cost to that! If you add big bits of functionality with just one click of a button, then there is going to be a trade off.</p>
<p>You *<em>might</em>* get away with it, but odds are when it comes to update time that it’s going to be that twitter feed plugin with 200 active installs and zero reviews that makes your site implode. If you really <em>absolutely</em> must install some new plugins, then always pick ones with good reviews and as many active installs as possible. For some niche plugins maybe in the thousands is OK, but for regular plugins you want ideally in the hundreds of thousands of active installs if not millions.</p>

					<h1>How much does a website cost?</h1>
<p><em>&#8216;It depends&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>A lot of people avoid answering this question directly because it really <em>does</em> depend and can be very variable. People also seem cautious about coming across as cheap (race to the bottom and bad) or over priced (overpricing yourself out of the market, also bad).</p>
<p>Ignoring that, and with a big ol&#8217; pinch of salt, let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Constants &#8211; hosting and domain</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the constants. You always need a domain name (your web address e.g. mysite.com) and a place for the files to live (your web hosting). Domain names are something like £10 &#8211; £20 a year and hosting depends on how many visitors you get. A typical website for a small business can easily get away with some half decent shared hosting like <a href="https://krystal.io">krystal.io</a> and it&#8217;ll cost you £80 &#8211; £100ish a year. Email service is something that in recent years you sometimes need to pay for. Typically £5 a month, but sometimes it&#8217;s included in the hosting up to a certain point (when your inbox has filled up and taken up too much space).</p>
<p>So ongoing costs you are looking at around £150 to keep a website running. This is true of a custom built WordPress site or a cheap DIY site. With a cheap DIY site this is all you pay!</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Cheap DIY Websites</h2>
<p>The cheapest possible website you can get is one you make yourself. Something like Wix or Squarespace. These generally charge a monthly fee of £10 &#8211; £15. That normally covers the hosting and the upkeep of the site. It&#8217;s cheap and cheerful &#8211; you pick a template and off you go. The downsides with this are obvious. Firstly you have to make it yourself, secondly it&#8217;s an off the shelf product so it&#8217;s not the highest quality and it will look like a lot of other peoples sites because they will have used the same template.</p>
<p>For some small businesses or individuals starting out, this is <em>maybe</em> going to do the job. Sometimes a website is essentially just an online business card &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t even need to rank highly in google searches, it just needs to be there where you tell the address to people for contact info. In this case then using a DIY site is a smart move. Don&#8217;t waste money on something that is untested and get your business off the ground. If it all starts to work out and you have plenty of profit you can invest in a better website later.</p>
<p>The key thing I&#8217;d advise for small businesses starting out in these sorts of cases is to at least invest a little bit of money is a simple logo or some sort of branding. It doesn&#8217;t have to be mega fancy, and it does depend on the industry you are in. For instance a food market business is going to need a nice logo a lot more than a tradesman where visual branding is less important.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Elementor and other Page Builders within WordPress</h2>
<p>I guess the next step up would be using something like WordPress with a page builder and a plugin like Elementor. These sorts of plugins have loads of built in layouts and it&#8217;s all drag and drop. You&#8217;ll need a developer to set them up but they&#8217;ll charge way less than a regular site &#8211; primarily because it&#8217;ll be a really bad website!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use page builders because they are the devils work. Their main problem is that they are a black box &#8211; of they break you have to contact the plugin developers, there is no way of fixing them or knowing what when wrong&#8230; and they do break. Aside from that they normally have some many layouts and functionality in them that the site looks like 10 pounds of stuff in a 5 pound bag. It&#8217;s a hot mess and it will usually cost you anything from £250 &#8211; £1k. Maybe this works for some people, but if I didn&#8217;t have the money for a proper website I&#8217;d sooner spend a little bit of cash on a decent logo and use a super simple and clean template with one of the DIY website builders.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Hiring a Freelancer</h2>
<p>The next step up would be hiring a freelancer or freelancers. If you needed full branding you&#8217;d want a designer and a developer. An averaged sized, professionally built brochureware site with full design and dev would cost around £8 &#8211; £10k. This assumes design and dev and roughly split 50/50. This can cost more in design if there isn&#8217;t an existing brand and you need print assets and the like.</p>
<p>A smaller site &#8211; say for a small business or an individual where you have maybe a handful of pages &#8211; about, contact, what you do type thing would cost more like £2.5k &#8211; £5k. It depends on the levels of design needed and functionality of course. You can save money by hiring someone like myself who will give you a decent level of design and a quality build but not all websites are created equal.</p>
<p>In this range you might also find people charging from £1.5 &#8211; £2.5k but you need to be careful you are not getting an off the shelf theme of a page builder. Every site I make uses a custom theme for that project &#8211; it&#8217;s always bespoke and any developer worth their salt will be doing that. You also want to pay attention to the level of design. Not everyone can spot or see the value in good design but bad design sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also find plenty people who <em>technically</em> know how to put a website together, but it ain&#8217;t going to be pretty. If it&#8217;s not at least neat looking, tidy and consistent then that is as just as much a black mark against it as being badly built and coded.</p>
<p>It is possible to find people out there who are good at <em>everything </em>but it&#8217;s pretty rare. As I&#8217;ve done so much front-end work over the years I&#8217;ve leant into design and learnt lots along the way. That&#8217;s made me care about and get pretty good at design (at least designing websites). You&#8217;ll find plenty of developers out there who are very technically gifted and can code all sorts&#8230; but they can&#8217;t make a website that looks neat and tidy on the front end and they can&#8217;t build something that a regular human with common sense would easily be able to use!</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Hiring an agency</h2>
<p>Agencies have higher over heads and charge as lot more. They quite often have dedicated departments &#8211; development, design etc. This means for something more specific and thorough you can go through a whole process. They also typically work on larger jobs. Anything from £15k &#8211; £100k+. It&#8217;s much like builders where you will find companies that specialise is loft extension that typically work on jobs of £50 &#8211; £60k. They rarely want to pick up a job that is £3 &#8211; £4k because for the way they are setup, it&#8217;s not worth their time. A lot of my work is doing builds for agencies and the work tends to take a bit longer as it&#8217;s more exacting and due to the nature of the process &#8211; usually fairly separate design and development.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more work to really nail the build so it matches the design perfectly. This is an extra level of detail and polish that isn&#8217;t required for everyone, but for some more established companies is essential to maintain their brand.</p>

<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Kitchens</h2>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to compare websites to something else, something tangible like a kitchen. At the low end of the scale the DIY site builders are akin to the cheapest Ikea kitchens. You can buy something off the shelf, and even add your own worktops and install yourself if you&#8217;re quite handy.</p>
<p>The next level up is the slightly fancier modular kitchens in Ikea. Working with a builder you can get something decent for a reasonable price. Ikea kitchens can also get quite fancy if you want them too and the price range varies massively. You are using off the shelf parts, but if you&#8217;re clever you can save money and still make it look nice. Conversely you can use still spend a fortune on an Ikea kitchen if you want all the bells and whistles and fancy work tops.</p>
<p>At the top end of the scale you can get a kitchen custom made. You could use someone like Howdens who design the kitchen first and plan out every detail. Further than that, you could find higher-end cabinet and kitchen makers where you get to pick the wood and it&#8217;s fully bespoke. These kitchens are obviously going to be way more expensive and not something that everyone wants and needs.</p>
<p>The point is there are lots of different needs and what is right for one person isn&#8217;t right for the next. Where do I sit in the strange analogy of kitchens?</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>The Sweet Spot</h2>
<p>The sweet spot for me isn&#8217;t cheap and it isn&#8217;t paying over the odds for a label or a badge. I want something high quality and robust, but I don&#8217;t always want to spend lots of money on something just because it&#8217;s fancy. For certain things I&#8217;ll push the boat out if I think it will last a long time and make a big impact.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s where a lot of people find themselves. They don&#8217;t want cheap, but they do want value for money and quality. You might be happy to pay for something robust and quality, but don&#8217;t care about paying for status.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I try to pitch myself and I try to work within sensible budgets and adjust as appropriate. I can absolutely build fancy hand crafted metaphorical kitchens but more often than not I&#8217;m using Ikea shells, a nice worktop and maybe some custom plywood doors (ply-kea for the win!). Always with the goal of crafting the best metaphorical kitchen (or just a real website) for your money.</p>

					<h1>What makes websites look good?</h1>
<p>Some designs stand out and look nice. This often comes across as a feeling &#8211; this website feels clean, or, this website feels modern. Sometimes though you aren&#8217;t sure why, but something just looks high quality. Designers usually know why! If you&#8217;re a designer this will be teaching you how to suck eggs so you might want to skip.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Start with the fundamentals</h2>
<p>There are some basic rules that all design has to follow to hit a threshold of looking &#8216;correct&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong> &#8211; Everything should be aligned with something else. Websites love a grid and that grid should 9 times out of 10 be stuck to. It just makes everything easy on the eye, calms everything down and users instinctively no where to look and can easily parse a page because of it</p>
<p><strong>Spacing</strong> &#8211; Things need room to breath. Space around something can draw attention to it and show where it sits in importance compared to other items. Space can be used to show that a certain group of items are related, and then larger amounts of space can show a break in related items</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> &#8211; Uniformness, standard rules. Things looking the same in terms of size and colour. This often means a restricted colour palette. Again, it all just makes everything easier to scan and read.</p>
<p>With these fundamentals down there are some rules of thumb that can really help elevate design.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Design heuristics</h2>
<p>The are lots of heuristics (rules of thumb) that help make things look interesting or engaging and often this span across all media &#8211; films, photography, painting, illustration and more. Two of the simplest ones for easy wins are the rules of thirds and the 60/30/10 rule</p>
<h3>The Rule of Thirds</h3>
<p>The rule of thirds is used in photography and in general composition. Using the rule of thirds you divide an image into nine equal parts using horizontal and vertical lines. When you want to draw attention to something you position it at the intersection of two of these lines. You can also place something else on another intersection and this even balances the image. Doing this we can direct the user to look in a certain place and it just creates a nice amount of tension and energy.</p>
<p>A website is primarily text with some images and sometimes video. Those images really stand out and it&#8217;s important that the images are interesting and composed nicely. A hero image (large image at the top of a page) is very common in web design, and these are often sourced by the companies themselves. Maybe they have a team shot &#8211; maybe they even got a professional photographer in to do it. If not then it&#8217;s important to note that not any all photo is going to look good on a site. You can&#8217;t just chuck a photo in the hero, stick a semi transparent overlay on it and slap a title on top. Well, you can (and people often do!) it just always massively detracts from the look of a site.</p>
<h3>60 / 30 / 10 rule</h3>
<p>This rule applies to lots of areas of design and art from renaissance paintings to interior design. The idea is that the composition of colour in the image should be made up roughly of 60% the primary colour, 30% the secondary colour and 10% accent colour. In practice each of these colours can be mulitple colours of a similar shade. For instance you may have a painting of the sea. 60% of it is blue colours (the primary colour), 30% is white (the secondary colour) and 10% is a little yellow boat (the accent colour). This leads to a nice balanced image with large spaces that appear more background, and peoples eyes drawn towards the accent colour.</p>
<p>We see this in web design all the time. 60% might be the white background colour, 30% might be a nice blue colour or shades of blue and the buttons, links and calls to actions (the last 10%) might be a nice orange that pops. This means that buttons and things you can click draw the eye and stand out.</p>
<h3>Colour Harmonies</h3>
<p>The 60/30/10 rule works especially well when combined with colour harmonies. Colour harmonies are colour palettes that create a sense of balance and contrast. There are loads of these, some of the more famous one being monochromatic (different shades of the same colour), complementary (opposites on the colour wheel e.g. blue and orange) and analogous (colours that site next to each other on the colour wheel e.g. red, yellow and orange). The point is, some combinations of colours just work better than others and it&#8217;s not just some subjective opinion. There is theory and some science (for want of a better word) behind it.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Good design isn&#8217;t just subjective</h2>
<p>There is far more to design than just pretty colours. These things usually have a rationale and are ultimately done to create a better product. There is a course such a thing as taste, and not everyone will like the same thing, but <em><strong>bad</strong></em> design when things are unintentionally misaligned or use clashing colours is an objective thing and sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>Sometimes when things just <em>&#8216;feel&#8217;</em> right it&#8217;s because a lot of thought and theory has gone into it behind the scenes!</p>

					<h2>Search Engine Optimisation Basics</h2>
<p>A lot of SEO is just common sense, and repetition. Strange then that the majority of SEO experts seem to selling you snake oil. The problem with SEO, like lots of things in life, is that it takes work, and there is no silver bullet. It&#8217;s a combination of lots of little things. The keys things that it&#8217;s made of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Good quality code and a fast site. Google likes sites that load fast and are built properly.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div></div>
<div>Properly structured content. A decent site structure, sensible page names and URLS, putting keywords in the H1 title tags, internally linking to pages.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>The content itself. It takes more repetition than you think and it really helps to target your content to specific searches e.g. &#8216;WordPress developer in Bristol&#8217;.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Links. You linking to other sites that build a picture that you work in this field. More importantly people linking to you (back links). The more involved in this line of work the sites that link to you are and the more prestigious the better.</div>
</li>
</ul>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Clean Code and a good structure</h2>
<p>Having a solid foundation of clean code and a planned out URL structure is the way to start. The titles should use a proper hierarchy. Ideally this is a heading 1 for the main title that matches the URL. The URLS should match your targetting search terms.</p>
<p>You need good page speed too and to not have a bloated site with unnecessary plugins. This is your starting point that any decent web developer worth their salt should be able to achieve.</p>

					<h2>Keyword, Location and Niche</h2>
<p>The key thing is to hone in on a term you want to rank for and make sure this is used liberally and featured in page URLS. You also need to pick a search term that is achievable and realistic. For instance &#8216;web developer for hire&#8217; is going to be really hard to rank for and does anyone even search like that?</p>
<p>A more achievable search to rank for would be &#8216;Bristol Web Developer&#8217;, which is also something people in Bristol are more likely to search for. By adding a location you are narrowing down the search and working towards the way people actually search. It&#8217;s for this reason you often find multiple pages for different areas in the service section of companies sites e.g. &#8216;Emergency Plumber in Bristol&#8217;, &#8216;Emergency Plummer in Bath&#8217;.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is target a narrower search. e.g. not &#8216;Bristol web developer&#8217; but &#8216;Bristol WordPress developer&#8217;. By niching down a bit more you shrink the audience, but increase your chances of ranking higher for that term.</p>
<p>If you google &#8216;Design agency Bristol&#8217; you&#8217;re going to get ALL the design agencies. Better to targer your niche e.g. &#8216;Events design agency Bristol&#8217; or &#8216;Brochure design agency Bristol&#8217;.</p>

					<h2>Repetition of Key Terms</h2>
<p>Google worked out a long time ago that people would be trying to crack their search algorithm and have had systems to combat keyword stuffing since they began. Keyword stuffing it just repeating the same term over and over, maybe even changing font colour to black and putting it on a black background and writing the term out 100 terms on a page.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t do that without being heavily penalised. What you can do though is write content in a natural way, <em>but</em> a slightly more long winded way. There is a style of content the search engines find easier to parse. Headings summarising a chapter followed by a short amount of content  (like this blog!). It&#8217;s actually an OK way to write, if not a little mechanical. A good way to repeat terms without needlessly repeating yourself is multiple pages filled with content and internal links.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Internal Links</h2>
<p>Internal links are ones that link to somewhere else on your site. So on your home page you could say that you do design work in Bristol and link to a page on your site that has the URL &#8216;design-work-in-bristol&#8217;. The bonus of using this key term in a page (and the matching title) is that every time you list out this link you are repeating the search term.</p>
<p>For instance &#8216;design in Bristol&#8217; might be in your main menu, then you might link body text on the home page that mentions it. Then maybe you are also listing out links in the footer.  Having links in the header and footer of the site (especially with long pages) is a useful thing to do &#8211; it&#8217;s repetition, but for a valid reason so google allows it.</p>
<p>Having thess internal links helps connect everything together. It makes a really clear site structure for googles robots to parse and make proper sense of the content of your site.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Inbound Links / Back Links</h2>
<p>Once you have clean code, a decent structure, and search friendly content the next step is trying to get backlinks. This is where other people link to your site.  Google uses these to get a picture of where you sit in the world and your industry. If you are claiming to be the best plumber in Bath is there any other info out there that supports this? Are other sites relating to plumbing or plumbing supplies linking to you?</p>
<p>The key here is building up authority and having quality back links. If you are a childrens author and you are getting linked to several well known publishing houses and online book retailers then it tells google that you are who you say you are, and that you are well known in these circles.</p>
<p>Back links can be tricky, not everyone has a reason to link to a plumbers website! What you can do at the very least is sign up to local societies e.g. trades man in Bath websites, guild of plumbers etc. This are often listing sites that will link to your site and help build up that picture for google that everything you do is plumbing (or whatever it is you do!) related.</p>
<p>Another good source of back links is social media and writing guest blogs in other media publications and websites. Obviously not everyone can do this (not sure how many plumber blogs there are) but creating content on YouTube and linking to it (and vice versa) helps build up that picture.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Blogging and regular content</h2>
<p>A good long term strategy for SEO is to have a blog on your website (oh, hi!). This gives you chances to expand on the content and keywords of your site. It also makes sure that you content keeps getting updated, so your site doesn&#8217;t look stagnant to google.</p>
<p>More than this you might get people finding your site through the content you make. For instance, an article you write could maybe be shared lots of times on social media, or maybe it&#8217;s a topic not many people are talking about.</p>
<p>In this case your article might become <em>the</em> article that appears when people search for this sort of thing. Again it all adds to connect all the dots for google. It also helps build trust and authority in space, and obviously it doesn&#8217;t have to purely cynical marketing &#8211; you can share useful information that helps people.</p>
<p>This is often seen with design communities or courses. They offer a free useful product or giveaway. A free font, a free icon set etc. It gets lots of traffic to their site, but also if it&#8217;s genuinely good and useful people might remember them and use them when they need design services.</p>

					<h1>Can we trust Google page speed for website performance?</h1>
<h2>What is website performance?</h2>
<p>Performance is how quickly a website loads and responds to user interactions. Why should we care about performance? A more performant site is going to load quicker. Say you are on a crappy 3G signal trying to book train tickets &#8211; you want that site to be loading as quickly as possible and even in less than ideal circumstances connectivity wise.</p>
<p>Then there is just the feel of a site. If every time you click a link you see the website thinking and trying to load it can be incredibly frustrating. For big online shops this can make or break them.</p>
<p>Last but not least we have SEO. Google loves fast websites and ranks them higher in google searches. So if we are at all concerned with our site being robust, being a pleasant experience for users and ranking on google then we need to pay attention to performance.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Getting good performance</h2>
<p>How do we get good performance then? A large part of it comes down to page speed. The smaller our site, the quicker it will load. This means makes a site with properly sized images, not using bloated plugins that drag in loads of extra resources. More than this, it often means designing with this mind. Do we really need all those extra images?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the dilema. If you want a really fast site, one of the best things you can do is just not include any content that takes time to load. Don&#8217;t use video, don&#8217;t use big images, don&#8217;t even load fancy fonts. What if your brand requires nice fonts though, or what if your businesss IS video? You&#8217;re going to want to show it off, so you&#8217;re going to need it on your site.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s always a balance. Sometimes you need rich media on the site, and the best you can do is include it in a sensible way. The right file formats, the right sizing and things like lazy loading (only load things when you need them).</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Static vs Dynamic sites</h2>
<p>WordPress sites are dynamic &#8211; the content is generated on the server and can change based on user actions, database queries, and other factors. This is opposed to static sites that are just serving up prerendered files of html that are static.</p>
<p>Static sites are much faster to load than dynamic sites, but they come with some drawbacks. They are more complicated to setup and host and their CMS options are not as good unless you put in a lot of extra work. With a JAM Stack site (Javascript, Apis, markup, something like Next.js and Gatsby) you can even use WordPress as a separate CMS (known as a headless CMS) but then you are essentially building two sites. One for the content management, and one to render the site. It&#8217;s a lot more work and it&#8217;s more complicated to maintain. If you are developer these may not be problems (some developers will find this setup easier to maintain) but for the average end user it&#8217;s just more complexity.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a pattern emerging here. What is your use case and how do you balance performance against business needs, design and various other factors?</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Measuring performance</h2>
<p>Even if we are going take the performance results with a pinch of salt and balance it with our other needs we still need some way of measuring performance. There are a few main tools for this &#8211; <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">Googles PageSpeed Insights</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview">Lighthouse</a> (a tool built into the chrome web browser), As well as performance they can also give you a score for accessibility, best practices and SEO.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; it works of an algorithm so it doesn&#8217;t care about you business and design needs. It&#8217;s going to favour light sites that are static. Getting cracking performance on a site with barely any images is going to be multitudes easier than a video heavy site. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the site that has worse performance was built in a worse way, it just has more stresses on it&#8217;s content and load times.</p>
			</div>
</section>


<section class="tombo-block tombo-text-block">
	<div class="wrapper">
					<h2>Performance Scores</h2>
<p>You will often see web developers showing off performance scores, but it&#8217;s important to look at the site and what it contains. Getting decent performance on a site filled with images and rich content is going to take way more work and skill then a super light site that is mostly text content.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a way to cheat these things to get higher scores. It cares about loading up front i.e. when you first load a page. You can lazy load things in later on scroll and they won&#8217;t get counted. You could load in a tonne of crap later and have a bloated and badly built site, but if you do it later these tools won&#8217;t know!</p>
<p>Here are the current performance scores for this site from google page speed checker:</p>

					<p>You&#8217;ll notice that getting a high score on mobile is much harder than desktop. There&#8217;s lot of reasons for this &#8211; the tests for mobile assume a slower internet connect akin to 4G vs hi speed broadband, the tests quite possibly use a mid tier mobile device, and then there are just different ways that mobile renders things (such as the power of the device).</p>
<p>You should also notice how high the other scores are compared to the performance. You can follow all the rules and best practices, but getting really good performance on mobile of google page speed is really hard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still a very useful tool, but next time you see a web developer showing off their performance scores take a look at their site and see how much content and images are actually on there. If they have an incredibly high score and lots of rich media then they know their stuff!</p>
<p>In order to get high scores on mobile they are likely using a static site or using a performance plugin. Performance plugins charge a monthly fee and do lots of things to heavily optimise, cache and speed up a website.</p>

					<h1>Website redesign and the future</h1>
<p>At the beginning of this year I came back to freelancing after a <a href="https://liamnguyen.dev/work/matter-ios-app/">2 year stint working in a neuroscience tech startup</a>. My website was hella&#8217; old, I can&#8217;t even remember exactly&#8230; 5, maybe even 8 years?! When you are freelancing, your work often comes from word of mouth. If you&#8217;re busy and things are ticking along your portfolio site can really take a back seat. Turns out my site took a back seat for half a decade.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no longer on the first page of google and <a href="https://old.liamnguyen.dev/">my site was looking a little crusty.</a> On top of this there&#8217;s been a uptick in the number of freelance web developers in my area, so I have fallen behind. Time to fix that! I wanted to differentiate myself, both in quality of work and in personality.</p>

					<h2>Web Developer Portfolios</h2>
<p>There is something of a look to your professional web developers site. Nothing wrong with it, but I guess &#8216;safe&#8217; would be the word? It&#8217;s more functional than &#8216;wow, that looks great.&#8217; Then you have porfolios of creative developers where the site is pretty out there &#8211; but often to the detriment of usability. I wanted to walk that fine line between the two. Something professional, but also <em>interesting</em> with some of my personality showing.</p>
<p>Having worked with a larger team and lots of designers for the past couple of years I&#8217;ve really narrowed down what it is that I am good at &#8211; and that&#8217;s high quality front-end and going the extra mile to match designs and understand design. I have the technical and problem solving skills to flesh out tangible ideas, but also really care about the execution of those ideas and ultimately, it looking and feeling good. I also love animation and interactivity so I wanted to do something that in some way showcased these skills without being totally off the wall.</p>

					<h2>Table Top Board Games</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing the <a href="https://themeborne.com/">themeborne</a> board games a lot recently, &#8216;<a href="https://themeborne.com/products/escape-the-dark-sector">Escape the Dark Sector</a>&#8216; and their Last of Us game &#8216;<a href="https://themeborne.com/products/the-last-of-us-escape-the-dark">The Last of Us: Escape the Dark</a>&#8220;. These games are gorgeous, all black and white with beautiful illustrations and dripping in atmosphere. The game mechanics are great, but the whole package, the way everything ties in together is just chefs kiss. As a developer and just general lover of good design I loved the tightness the black and white constraints produced&#8230; so I thought I&#8217;d steal that idea for my site.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately for me, the artwork of these games relies heavily on some excellent hand drawn illustrations. I like to draw, but I’m a mediocore at best and knew it would be far too time consuming and not good enough if I attempted the art myself. Instead I turned to AI.</p>
<p>I know, I know. The elephant in the room. I’m very conflicted about AI art and I have good friends that are illustrators, but still, I wanted to give it a shot and see if a certain quality bar could be reached.</p>

					<h2>AI and the future</h2>
<p>A big thing in the development world (and the world in general) is obviously AI. I&#8217;ve been tinkering with it for a while, but it&#8217;s now caused something of a sea change. There is a genuine fear of job losses and a shrinking of the market, but AI is clearly not going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>If AI can write code and produce art, then what&#8217;s the point in a developer or a designer? Well, can AI do all that by itself? Or does it need someone to curate these ideas who knows if they are worth anything? I can only hope that the latter is true!</p>
<p>As a developer of 15 something years I&#8217;m no stranger to learning new things. You&#8217;ve always gotta be keeping up with the times, learning new tools, new languages. AI is no different?</p>
<p>Either way, I took this as an opportunity to retool, brush up skills and get up to date the latest web dev techniques, including AI.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve upgraded my text editor to <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, which comes with Claude AI baked in. It&#8217;s crazy how far things have come and how fast, and it&#8217;s clear to see how this stuff is game changing for productivity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also been playing around with AI art generation in Midjourney. With all this in mind I set about redesigning my site.</p>

					<h2>AI Dystopian Art</h2>
<p>Getting something half decent out of Midjourney is relatively easy, but getting something cohesive across a range of images is a lot trickier. I think it really helped having a strict style in mind (black and white ink, hand drawn looking).</p>
<p>Still, it proved tricky. Originally I wanted to go down the Last of Us theme more. The majority of Bristol design agencies and freelancers are on a real &#8216;design for positive change&#8217; tip at the moment. I&#8217;m pleased that people retain their optimism in these <em>interesting times, </em>but I don&#8217;t feel there is much I can add to that well- trodden ground.</p>
<p>I wanted to take a slight risk and stand out a bit more. It almost became a bit of joke that if everyone else if trying to save the world and be nice should I be doing the opposite? I&#8217;m not that much of a contrarian that I&#8217;ll do anything just to stand out, but this combined with my love of the themeborne aesthetic and atmosphere were leading me towards something dystopian!</p>
<p>It played into the freelance angle too and my sense of pragmatism. Developer survival in a cold dark world.</p>

					<p>In the end this route felt a bit too gimmicky (as possible gloomy!) and it was very hard to get consistent AI art with this theme. Too many zombies, too on the nose. With some experimentation and tweaking I went where the AI art took me, and that was this brutalist &#8216;T&#8217; monolith. It had a gritty &#8216;sci-fi aesthetic that had the right about of doom for my sensibilities but with some light and shade. More of a sense of adventure, and the future (obviously).</p>

					<h2>Science Fiction</h2>
<p>So AI led me in the direction science fiction. I love me some Sci-fi. Films, books, anime, board games, video games &#8211; I&#8217;ll take it in any medium, so this was a good fit. This in turn helped dictate some of the animation. I liked the idea of retro futurism and &#8216;Cassette Futurism&#8217; &#8211; sort of a 70s sci-fi, CRT screens and analogue tape feel. A little dose of that combined with your more serious Interstellar and Dune-esque aesthetics and I ended up here.</p>
<p>I am in the middle of reading a book on white holes (as you do) and this coincided with me playing around with SVG filters to create this vortex style effect on the homepage. It made sense to have a light and dark mode to match the black and white holes.</p>
<p>The brutalist T is obviously reflects my common as much name, but more broadly represents my skills in a T shape with your breadth of knowledge going across and then some specialist knowledge deep knowledge going down.</p>

					<h2>Something Cohesive</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m sure these levels of meaning are lost to all but me, but heh, I&#8217;m really happy with the results and that the design reflects some of my tastes. Hopefully it balances this with looking professional and enough broad appeal that it doesn&#8217;t alienate (I went there) anyone.</p>
<p>As well as trying to do something a bit more personal, it was a fun exercise in using AI tools to try and create something a little different, but still a solid and cohesive idea.</p>
